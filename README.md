# Resource Scheduling System â€“ Advanced Academic Resource Scheduling System (Frontend)

## Overview

**Resource Scheduling System** is a feature-rich frontend application for a highly sophisticated academic scheduling system, used by university administration, advisors, and DEOs. It provides granular control and visibility over timetabling, batch and course management, preferences, compensatory classes, availability, and user/discipline management.  
**This frontend is tightly integrated with [FYPBackend](https://github.com/subhan-uf/fypbackend), which handles all data, business logic, and scheduling algorithms.**

## Deployment & Adoption

**The Resource Scheduling System is currently implemented at NED University of Engineering and Technology and actively used by multiple departments.**  
It streamlines complex scheduling workflows for faculty, advisors, and administrative staff across various academic programs.
